A Hello World example of using `session$user` and `session$group` in a Shiny app in deployed content. 

Note the app will show `default user` and `default group` if `session$user` and `session$group` are not found (either because you are working locally, not on Connect; or because the user viewing the content is not logged in to Connect).
